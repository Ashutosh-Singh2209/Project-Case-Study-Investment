# Project-Case-Study-Investment

## Overview

This project was completed during my codingninjas data analytics course. It primarily involves the use of Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and some knowledge of NumPy.

The goal of this project is to explore a CSV dataset, gaining insights into patterns related to startup fundings during the years 2015 to 2017.

## Questions to Explore

1. Find out what type of startups are receiving funding in recent years.
2. Identify the key investors involved.
3. Determine the prominent fields receiving significant funding.

The dataset contains funding information for Indian startups from January 2015 to August 2017. Further details about the columns in this dataset can be found in the corresponding Google Colab notebook.

I utilized Python libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib, to perform the analysis.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook, simply open it in Google Colab. Upload the dataset to the Colab environment, and you're good to go.

## Code and Data Documentation

The detailed procedure, along with the code and dataset information, is provided in the notebook's markdown file.

## Results

The outcomes of the analysis provide comprehensive insights into the dataset, revealing the following:
